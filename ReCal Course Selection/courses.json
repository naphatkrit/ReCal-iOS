Laboratories and fieldwork will explore the process of translating observations and data into an understanding of how the natural world works.", "id": 436, "registrar_id": "1152001538", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/course/436/", "sections": [{"course": "/course_selection/api/v1/course/436/", "id": 1133, "meetings": [{"days": "Th ", "end_time": "04:20 PM", "id": 1147, "location": "Lewis Library 121", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/meeting/1147/", "section": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1133/", "start_time": "01:30 PM"}], "name": "B01", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1133/", "section_type": "LAB"}, {"course": "/course_selection/api/v1/course/436/", "id": 1134, "meetings": [{"days": "Th ", "end_time": "04:20 PM", "id": 1148, "location": "", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/meeting/1148/", "section": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1134/", "start_time": "01:30 PM"}], "name": "B02", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1134/", "section_type": "LAB"}, {"course": "/course_selection/api/v1/course/436/", "id": 1135, "meetings": [{"days": "F ", "end_time": "04:20 PM", "id": 1149, "location": "Lewis Library 121", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/meeting/1149/", "section": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1135/", "start_time": "01:30 PM"}], "name": "B03", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1135/", "section_type": "LAB"}, {"course": "/course_selection/api/v1/course/436/", "id": 1136, "meetings": [{"days": "W ", "end_time": "04:20 PM", "id": 1150, "location": "Lewis Library 122", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/meeting/1150/", "section": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1136/", "start_time": "01:30 PM"}], "name": "B04", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1136/", "section_type": "LAB"}, {"course": "/course_selection/api/v1/course/436/", "id": 1137, "meetings": [{"days": "T ", "end_time": "04:20 PM", "id": 1151, "location": "Lewis Library 121", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/meeting/1151/", "section": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1137/", "start_time": "01:30 PM"}], "name": "B06", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1137/", "section_type": "LAB"}, {"course": "/course_selection/api/v1/course/436/", "id": 1132, "meetings": [{"days": "T Th ", "end_time": "12:20 PM", "id": 1146, "location": "Schultz Laboratory 107", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/meeting/1146/", "section": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1132/", "start_time": "11:00 AM"}], "name": "L01", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/section/1132/", "section_type": "LEC"}], "semester": {"end_date": "2015-02-01", "id": 1, "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/semester/1/", "start_date": "2014-09-10", "term_code": "1152"}, "title": "Ecology: Species Interactions, Biodiversity and Society"}, {"course_listings": [{"course": "/course_selection/api/v1/course/437/", "dept": "EEB", "is_primary": true, "number": "323", "resource_uri": "/course_selection/api/v1/course_listing/757/"}], "description": "This course will explore the fundamental principles that underline the evolution and mechanism of animal behavior.
